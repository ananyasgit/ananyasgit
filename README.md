## Hi there 👋, I am Ananya.
#### I am currently a final year engineering student majoring in IT.
Being an AI and Data Science enthusiast, I have worked on analyzing data related to various ML,DL models (NLP, LSTM, Classification etc.) and training them in Jupyter Notebook. I have previously worked on NLP in conversational AI bots, and on computer vision based SOTA models such as Yolov8 for object detection.

- 🔭 &nbsp;I’m currently working on 2 cool DL projects 😉
- 🌱 &nbsp;I’m currently learning Data Analysis with SQL and Python
- ⚡ &nbsp;Fun fact: I ❤️ to sketch and paint
